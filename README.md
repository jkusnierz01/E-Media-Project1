# E-Media Project 1: Analysis of Selected Multimedia File Format

## Project Overview

This project involves creating an application that decodes information contained in the header of a selected multimedia file, such as a graphic file (e.g., PNG, BMP, JPG) or an audio file (e.g., WAV). The metadata must be manually read by analyzing the successive bytes of the file.

## Requirements

1. **Decode File Header Information**
   - Read and display the file attributes (size, color depth, sampling rate, etc.).
   - Display the Fourier spectrum of the file using Fourier transformation. Full information must be displayed. You may use existing solutions, including loading pixel data using a chosen library.
   - Propose a method to test the correctness of the transformation.
   - Provide an option to delete all unnecessary file information, allowing for file anonymization without altering the image/sound.

2. **Presentation and Justification**
   - The project group presents the program and justifies the decisions made, especially concerning anonymization.
   - Discussion about the code to verify understanding of its functionality.
   - Optional test of the program on random data.
   - Discussion about the use of Fourier transformation in the context of the selected multimedia format.
   - Submission of the source code for archival purposes.

## Additional Information

- Preferred group size is 2 people.
- Any programming language can be used (consider the second part of the project when choosing).
- The program does not need a GUI, but adding one is encouraged. There are no requirements regarding ergonomics and aesthetics.
